# Signal Classification and Reconstruction Network (SCRNet)
The <b>Signal Classification and Reconstruction Network (SCRNet)</b> is an innovative deep neural architecture designed to effectively handle compressed and noisy character image data, specifically tailored for tasks such as character recognition and image restoration. SCRNet integrates two primary functional pathways to achieve simultaneous classification and reconstruction, enhancing performance and robustness through their synergistic interaction.
